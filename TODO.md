# TODO List

- [x] Headquarter count: Fix.
- [x] Lesser or equal priority message overwriting. If none found, overwrite oldest message.

- [ ] Add dedicated channels for maintaining count of units

## Carriers
- [ ] Carriers need to explore more and avoid overcrowding
- [ ] Prioritize resource collection based on lack of a resource.

## Build Order:

- [ ] Change to Finite State Machine micro.
- [ ] Try to shift code to microbattle if possible
- [ ] Add hiding in clouds and better attacking comms

## Combat

- [x] Verify combat message types' priority order
